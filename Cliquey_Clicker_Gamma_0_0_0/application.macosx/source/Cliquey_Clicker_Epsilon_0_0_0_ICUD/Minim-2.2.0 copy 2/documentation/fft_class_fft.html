    <td valign=top class="descList">FFT stands for Fast Fourier Transform. It is an efficient way to calculate the Complex 
 Discrete Fourier Transform. There is not much to say about this class other than the fact 
 that when you want to analyze the spectrum of an audio buffer you will almost always use 
 this class. One restriction of this class is that the audio buffers you want to analyze 
 must have a length that is a power of two. If you try to construct an FFT with a 
 <code>timeSize</code> that is not a power of two, an IllegalArgumentException will be 
 thrown.
 <p>
 A Fourier Transform is an algorithm that transforms a signal in the time
 domain, such as a sample buffer, into a signal in the frequency domain, often
 called the spectrum. The spectrum does not represent individual frequencies,
 but actually represents frequency bands centered on particular frequencies.
 The center frequency of each band is usually expressed as a fraction of the
 sampling rate of the time domain signal and is equal to the index of the
 frequency band divided by the total number of bands. The total number of
 frequency bands is usually equal to the length of the time domain signal, but
 access is only provided to frequency bands with indices less than half the
 length, because they correspond to frequencies below the <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency">Nyquist frequency</a>.
 In other words, given a signal of length <code>N</code>, there will be
 <code>N/2</code> frequency bands in the spectrum.
 <p>
 As an example, if you construct an FFT with a
 <code>timeSize</code> of 1024 and and a <code>sampleRate</code> of 44100
 Hz, then the spectrum will contain values for frequencies below 22010 Hz,
 which is the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate). If you ask for the
 value of band number 5, this will correspond to a frequency band centered on
 <code>5/1024 * 44100 = 0.0048828125 * 44100 = 215 Hz</code>. The width of
 that frequency band is equal to <code>2/1024</code>, expressed as a
 fraction of the total bandwidth of the spectrum. The total bandwith of the
 spectrum is equal to the Nyquist frequency, which in this case is 22050, so
 the bandwidth is equal to about 50 Hz. It is not necessary for you to
 remember all of these relationships, though it is good to be aware of them.
 The function <code>getFreq()</code> allows you to query the spectrum with a
 frequency in Hz and the function <code>getBandWidth()</code> will return
 the bandwidth in Hz of each frequency band in the spectrum.
 <p>
 <b>Usage</b>
 <p>
 A typical usage of the FFT is to analyze a signal so that the
 frequency spectrum may be represented in some way, typically with vertical
 lines. You could do this in Processing with the following code, where
 <code>audio</code> is an AudioSource and <code>fft</code> is an FFT.
 
 <pre>
 fft.forward(audio.left);
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; fft.specSize(); i++)
 {
   // draw the line for frequency band i, scaling it by 4 so we can see it a bit better
   line(i, height, i, height - fft.getBand(i) * 4);
 }
 </pre>
 
 <b>Windowing</b>
 <p>
 Windowing is the process of shaping the audio samples before transforming them
 to the frequency domain. The Fourier Transform assumes the sample buffer is is a 
 repetitive signal, if a sample buffer is not truly periodic within the measured
 interval sharp discontinuities may arise that can introduce spectral leakage.
 Spectral leakage is the speading of signal energy across multiple FFT bins. This
 "spreading" can drown out narrow band signals and hinder detection.
 </p>
 <p>
 A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">windowing function</a>
 attempts to reduce spectral leakage by attenuating the measured sample buffer
 at its end points to eliminate discontinuities. If you call the <code>window()</code> 
 function with an appropriate WindowFunction, such as <code>HammingWindow()</code>,
 the sample buffers passed to the object for analysis will be shaped by the current
 window before being transformed. The result of using a window is to reduce
 the leakage in the spectrum somewhat.
 <p>
 <b>Averages</b>
 <p>
 FFT also has functions that allow you to request the creation of
 an average spectrum. An average spectrum is simply a spectrum with fewer
 bands than the full spectrum where each average band is the average of the
 amplitudes of some number of contiguous frequency bands in the full spectrum.
 <p>
 <code>linAverages()</code> allows you to specify the number of averages
 that you want and will group frequency bands into groups of equal number. So
 if you have a spectrum with 512 frequency bands and you ask for 64 averages,
 each average will span 8 bands of the full spectrum.
 <p>
 <code>logAverages()</code> will group frequency bands by octave and allows
 you to specify the size of the smallest octave to use (in Hz) and also how
 many bands to split each octave into. So you might ask for the smallest
 octave to be 60 Hz and to split each octave into two bands. The result is
 that the bandwidth of each average is different. One frequency is an octave
 above another when it's frequency is twice that of the lower frequency. So,
 120 Hz is an octave above 60 Hz, 240 Hz is an octave above 120 Hz, and so on.
 When octaves are split, they are split based on Hz, so if you split the
 octave 60-120 Hz in half, you will get 60-90Hz and 90-120Hz. You can see how
 these bandwidths increase as your octave sizes grow. For instance, the last
 octave will always span <code>sampleRate/4 - sampleRate/2</code>, which in
 the case of audio sampled at 44100 Hz is 11025-22010 Hz. These
 logarithmically spaced averages are usually much more useful than the full
 spectrum or the linearly spaced averages because they map more directly to
 how humans perceive sound.
 <p>
 <code>calcAvg()</code> allows you to specify the frequency band you want an
 average calculated for. You might ask for 60-500Hz and this function will
 group together the bands from the full spectrum that fall into that range and
 average their amplitudes for you.
 <p>
 If you don't want any averages calculated, then you can call
 <code>noAverages()</code>. This will not impact your ability to use
 <code>calcAvg()</code>, it will merely prevent the object from calculating
 an average array every time you use <code>forward()</code>.
 <p>
 <b>Inverse Transform</b>
 <p>
 FFT also supports taking the inverse transform of a spectrum.
 This means that a frequency spectrum will be transformed into a time domain
 signal and placed in a provided sample buffer. The length of the time domain
 signal will be <code>timeSize()</code> long. The <code>set</code> and
 <code>scale</code> functions allow you the ability to shape the spectrum
 already stored in the object before taking the inverse transform. You might
 use these to filter frequencies in a spectrum or modify it in some other way.</td>
