  * This sketch demonstrates how to implement an AudioListener and then add and remove it from one of Minim's 
  * classes that support AudioListeners: AudioPlayer, AudioSample, AudioOutput, and AudioInput. 
  *
  * An AudioListener is an interface that you can implement in your own classes, which allows you to receive
  * sample buffers from sound generating classes immediately after they are generated. This is particularly 
  * useful when you are doing audio analysis because it ensures that you will only see each buffer of audio
  * once. If instead you perform your analysis in the draw method of your sketch, you might get less than 
  * perfect results because they audio samples may change while you are observing them. This happens because 
  * the audio is generated in a different thread of execution than draw is called from.
  *  
  * You can add an instance of an AudioListener to a sound generating object by using the addListener 
  * method of the class. If you want to remove a listener that you previously added, you call the
  * removeListener method, passing the listener you want to remove.
  *
  * Although possible, it is not advised that you add the same listener to more than one sound generating object. 
  * Your listener will be called any time any of the objects you've added it to have new samples. 
  * This means that the stream of samples the listener sees will likely be interleaved buffers of samples from 
  * all of the objects it is listening to, which is probably not what you want.

// You'll notice that the three methods of this class are synchronized. This is because the samples methods 
// will be called from a different thread than the one instances of this class will be created in. That thread 
// might try to send samples to an instance of this class while the instance is in the middle of drawing the 
// waveform, which would result in a waveform made up of samples from two different buffers. Synchronizing 
// all the methods means that while the main thread of execution is inside draw, the thread that calls 
// samples will block until draw is complete. Likewise, a call to draw will block if the sample thread is inside 
// one of the samples methods. Hope that's not too confusing!
